    Bagels are known for their chewy crust and soft interior. Traditionally, the
    dough is first boiled and then baked, which creates their distinctive texture.
    New York–style bagels are especially famous for their dense, chewy bite and are
    often enjoyed with cream cheese, smoked salmon, or a variety of sandwich fillings.
